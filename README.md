# Spotify Analytics

This report is designed to help provide insight into how Spotify collects and categorizes data on the music that is available on their platform.

The concept of this is exciting to me, because it is a combination of hard data and musical arts, two of my passions. The idea of turning artistic expression and entertainment into numbers and algorithms can be done in so many different methods, so there can be a lot to learn from one of the largst music platforms that uses its data to succesfully compile playlists and song recomendations for its customers.

This report will be organized in different sections of analysis. These sections are as follows:
#### **Data Organization**
#### **My Playlist Data**
#### **Creating My Algorithm** (PENDING)

Each section will be a report on the sections topic. I will provide scripts of code used for each section. Since this data will be using data from Spotify's API service, using this code requires users to have or gain authorization to Spotify's API.
